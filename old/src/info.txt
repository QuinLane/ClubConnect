Firebase.js - intializes all firebase services (Auth,Firestore,Realtime Database) 
and exports them to use in other parts in the app. Acts as central hub for Firebase access

index.css - global css styles for the whole app

main.jsx - Entry point for the react app. Renders root component into DOM (currently HomePage)

assets - stores all of our static assets (images,logos, fonts, etc.)

structure - contains all the structure files for our Firebase Firestore collections. 
this defines the schema and helper/creation functions for our data. Imported whenever needing
to validate/create data

Components - Reusable UI components that can be used across different pages. Typically smaller
Ex: button,form,card.
Building block for the UI, imported into pages to create full screens.

Pages - Stores page-level components that represent entire screens or routes in our app.
Each page typically combines multiple components to create the complete page. Rendered based on a router which well add later

Breakdown:
